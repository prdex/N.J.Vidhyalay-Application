## Usage example

I believe each school is unique in it's own way, and each one has it's own needs.
I have started with some of the basic feature like Homework Submission, Test Records, Attendence Record, Downlaod and View Textbook , and Download and View Material.
There will be a digital copy of their homework book - How cool is that.
With Adding more analytics to their test records parents, teachers and himself can know the strong and weak points in his studies.
Internet is a beautiful place, there is just ton of information out there ready for you to grab, with the help of teachers and management useful and intresting stuff won't make their study a load. Grow and find your passion is what matters.
Now the idea is to make another app for teachers where they can add marks, check homework, and add daily attendence.
