## Usage example

I belive each school is unique in it's own way, and each one has it's own needs, there is a lot we can do here
Many schools are starting to adapt new technologies in a wonderful manner.
With apps like this not only student can keep a trak between homework
and it's not just for students the parents can track their son/daughter's exam records from that techers, students,and parents can know the strong and wea points of student.
Internet is a beautiful place, there is just ton of information out there ready for you to grab, with apps like this students will be guided by teachers and management to support their studies and make it more intresting.
